# Direct Token Trader

This app allows people to list their ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 tokens to sell directly to another Ethereum user.

Sellers can create sell orders with their desired payment amounts. They can use the custom ID hash of their order to share with others. Buyers can use this ID to find and purchase the NFT or fungible tokens at the listed cost.

Users can choose whether to open for anyone to buy or only allow one account to purchase. In this case, it can be used to avoid requiring an escrow service. The seller creates the order specifically for a buyer, and the buyer closes the deal by exchanging the desired ETH.

Use cases:
* Private OTC token sales
* 1-to-1 NFT sales
* Private NFT sales
